# Detect Capital - C# Implementation

## 📌 About the Project
This project implements a solution to the **"Detect Capital"** problem from LeetCode ([520. Detect Capital](https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/description/)) using **C# and .NET 7**.

The program receives a word from the user and checks if it meets the correct usage of capital letters as defined by the problem on LeetCode:
- All letters are uppercase (e.g., "USA").
- All letters are lowercase (e.g., "leetcode").
- Only the first letter is uppercase (e.g., "Google").

If the word meets one of these criteria, the program will return a confirmation; otherwise, it will display an error message.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **C#** - Main programming language.
- **.NET 7** - Platform used for running the program.
- **LINQ** - Utilized to check conditions on the characters of the word.

## 📥 Requirements for Execution
To run this program, you will need:
- **.NET 7 SDK** installed ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)).
- A terminal or command prompt to execute the code.

## 🛠 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Rafa-Matheus/Detect-Capital-Easyct.git
   cd Detect-Capital-Easyct
   ```
2. Build the code:
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
4. Enter a word when prompted and observe the program's output.

## 📜 Rules and Constraints Implemented
The program implements **all constraints from the LeetCode problem**:
- The word must contain **only uppercase and/or lowercase letters**.
- The word length must be between **1 and 100 characters**.

If the user enters invalid input, the program will display an appropriate error message.

## 🏆 Code Highlights
✅ **Input Validation**: The program checks if the word contains only letters and adheres to the allowed length limit.  
✅ **Use of LINQ**: The correct usage of capitalization is implemented concisely and efficiently using **LINQ**.  
✅ **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: Users receive clear instructions on how to input data.
